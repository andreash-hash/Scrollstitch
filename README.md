# ScrollSnap

Turn a scrolling screen recording into one long, seamless screenshot (PNG/JPEG + PDF).

- **Client** (Expo / React Native, `app/`): picks a screen recording, extracts a frame
  every 300 ms, runs a rough on-device dedup, uploads the frames, and polls live
  processing progress.
- **Server** (Node + Express + Sharp, `server/`): validates the frames, deduplicates
  them (16×16 perceptual hash), detects and removes sticky headers/footers, greedily
  selects the best frames by NCC overlap, stitches everything into one image, and
  renders a PDF.

## Scripts

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run server:dev` | Start the processing server (port 5000) |
| `npm run expo:dev` | Start the Expo client |
| `npm test` | End-to-end pipeline tests on synthetic recordings (CI-friendly) |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint (expo config) |

## Pipeline

`POST /api/process-frames` → validate → dedup → sticky removal → **greedy frame
selection** → stitch → PDF. Progress (stage, percent, frame counter) is polled via
`GET /api/progress/:jobId`; the final result includes per-seam diagnostics
(overlap px, NCC, threshold used) plus any warnings — e.g. scroll-jump "gaps" —
which the client surfaces in the UI.

## CHANGELOG

### 2026-07 — Real-recording fixes (fast flicks, iOS preview)

- **Denser frame sampling**: 300 ms sampling missed all overlap during flick
  scrolls (a flick moves 1–1.5 screen heights per 300 ms → every seam became a
  gap). Extraction now samples every 150 ms, widening adaptively so long videos
  stay ≤ 240 frames; the dedup passes discard the surplus on slow sections.
- **Blank-frame guards**: iOS Safari can fire `seeked` before the frame is
  decoded, capturing all-black frames. The web extractor now probes the canvas
  and retries/skips blanks; the server validation also drops uniform
  near-black frames with a warning instead of letting them force gaps.
- **Display preview**: iOS refuses to decode very large images (a long stitch
  is easily 50+ MP and rendered black). Results above 12 MP now ship with a
  downscaled JPEG `previewUrl` for on-screen use; saving/sharing still uses
  the full-resolution image. The crop endpoint got the same treatment.
- **Actionable gap summary**: when gaps dominate the seams, the result leads
  with one clear warning ("scrolling was too fast — re-record with a slower,
  steadier scroll") instead of dozens of per-seam messages.

### 2026-07 — RevenueCat merge repair

- Restored the stitching-completion work below after a Replit push (RevenueCat
  integration) was based on a stale working copy and reverted the server
  pipeline, tests, and client progress/warning UI. RevenueCat additions
  (paywall, entitlement gating, `/privacy` page, seed scripts) are kept intact.
- Fixed the committed `package-lock.json` pointing at Replit's internal
  package proxy (`package-firewall.replit.local`), which broke `npm install`
  everywhere outside Replit.
- Fixed a type error in `scripts/seedRevenueCat.ts` (SDK `Duration` type) and
  three lint errors (unescaped apostrophes) in the new subscription UI;
  rebuilt `server_dist/` from the restored sources.

### 2026-07 — Stitching completion

- **Greedy frame selection** (`selectFrames`): frames are walked chronologically and
  kept only when their NCC overlap against the last kept frame lands in the
  ~20–60 % window; >80 % overlap (near-duplicates) is skipped. Skipped-but-measurable
  frames are remembered and promoted when needed, so greedy skipping never
  manufactures a gap and the bottom of the scroll is never lost. Frames with no
  measurable overlap are still kept, with the seam marked **"gap"**, a server-side
  warning log, and a warning surfaced to the client UI.
- **Adaptive NCC confidence**: the acceptance threshold now scales with the measured
  contrast of the overlap zone (0.85 for high-contrast content, floor 0.75 for
  dark/low-contrast screens). Measured NCC, applied threshold, and contrast are
  logged per seam and returned in the result's seam summary.
- **Fine-search before rejection**: the ±16 px fine pass now runs *before* the
  confidence check, so true overlaps that sit between coarse 8 px samples are no
  longer rejected on JPEG-noisy content.
- **Dark-screen dedup fix**: frame signatures gained a contrast-normalised channel
  (still 16×16 @ 0.93) so distinct dark frames are no longer collapsed as
  duplicates, while static screens still dedup correctly.
- **Bounded memory stitching**: frames are decoded one at a time into a single
  preallocated RGB canvas (no per-frame buffer retention) — 85 frames stitch in
  seconds within a few hundred MB. Outputs too tall for JPEG (>65 500 px)
  automatically fall back to PNG; absurdly large outputs fail with a clear error.
- **Robust errors & progress**: undecodable frames are skipped with a warning
  (fully corrupt uploads fail with a clear message), empty uploads are rejected,
  and every stage reports fine-grained progress (`progress` + `detail` frame
  counter) that the client now renders directly instead of simulated ticks.
- **Client**: shows gap/scroll-jump warnings on the result screen, uses real
  server progress, and fixes the web frame-hash helper (`new Image()` resolved to
  the expo-image component, breaking on-device dedup on web).
- **Tests**: `npm test` runs synthetic end-to-end suites — a generated page is cut
  into JPEG-compressed frames (optionally with sticky header/footer, scroll jumps,
  near-duplicates, dark theme, keyboard overlays, corrupt files, 1–2 frames,
  85-frame memory check) and the stitched output is verified against the original
  page, both by geometry and by locating content strips. An HTTP-level suite
  covers upload → progress → result → download and error reporting.
- Removed the last remnants of the old fingerprint matching approach; typecheck
  (`tsc --noEmit`) and lint are clean.
